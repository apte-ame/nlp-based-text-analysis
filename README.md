# Novel Text NLP Analysis 📚
## on book : _Playing It My Way by Sachin Tendulkar_
Hi there! 👋

Welcome to Book NLP Analysis, a project that lets you explore and understand books using natural language processing techniques. 

### In this project, you will learn how to: 

- Visualize the similarity between different parts of a book and identify key themes or topics using `BERT embedding` 📊
- Summarize the book by selecting the most relevant sentences that capture the main idea of each chapter or section using `TextRank algorithm` 📝
- Understand how different elements of the book are connected and interact with each other using graphs and relations between entities (such as characters, places, events) using `clustering techniques`🕸️
- Group sentences that have similar meanings or contexts and reduce dimensionality for better visualization using `K-medoids` with `PCA` and `sklearn`. 🗃️
- Identify the most frequent or significant words in the book and their probabilities of occurrence using `Bayesian regression` and `word cloud generation`. 🌥️
- Understand how different aspects of the book affect each other and influence its overall tone or mood using `Generalized Linear Model (GLM)`. 🎭

### This project uses various Python libraries such as : 
* NLTK 
* Spacy
* TextHero
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* WordCloud
* Scipy
* Statsmodels 

#### The code is well-documented and organized into different modules for easy readability. 🐍
-	To run this project locally, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine along with all the required libraries mentioned above. You can install them using pip or conda commands. 💻

-	To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and open the notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. You can also download the book data from this link and place it in the data folder. 📁


### Then, follow the instructions in the notebook and enjoy the analysis!
